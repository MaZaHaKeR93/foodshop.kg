Впрочем, чашечка кофе не только пункт в меню, это повод для встречи, приятный ритуал, который в разное время суток может иметь различное дополнение. Утром – кофе с молоком плюс яблочный пирог – быстрый завтрак. Днем – ароматный эспрессо с чизкейком - приятная передышка. Вечером…\nА вот вечером возможны варианты. И ради чашечки вечернего кофе лучше отправиться в кофейню.\nПервая кофейня «Coffee» гостеприимно распахнула свои двери в марте 2006 года и положила начало созданию кофейной культуры в Киргизии. Кофейня «Coffee» - место, где не только подают кофе, но и создают уютную атмосферу общения для самой широкой аудитории. Спешит ли наш гость, и может провести в кофейне всего несколько минут, или, человеку захотелось обдумать какие-то идеи, провести деловую встречу, а может побыть наедине с собой, атмосфера кофейни располагает к тому, чтобы все они чувствовали себя как дома…"], ["created_at", "2017-08-29 07:56:34.467044"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-29 07:56:34.467044"]]

В нем можно увидеть более двадцати видов пасты и вкусную пиццу во всем ее разнообразии, ризотто и домашние равиоли, классические итальянские блюда и интересные фирменные предложения от шеф-повара, которые по достоинству оценили даже гурманы из самой Италии.\n«Циклон» — это место, где можно ощутить итальянское гостеприимство, дружеские отношения с персоналом и конечно же попробовать традиционную итальянскую кухню"], ["created_at", "2017-08-29 07:56:34.555902"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-29 07:56:34.555902"]]
